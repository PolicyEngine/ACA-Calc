## Overview

The Inflation Reduction Act enhanced ACA subsidies through 2025. This calculator shows what your credits would be in 2026 with and without extending these enhancements.

**Key Differences:**
- **With IRA Extension**: No income cap, lower premium contributions (0-8.5% of income)
- **After IRA Expires**: 400% FPL cap ("subsidy cliff"), higher contributions (2-9.5% of income)
